Fix (after initial release):
  ☐ Context
    ☐ Find a way to create associations between modules (child + parent). stylus rendering order works differently than SASS
      - This is essential for `describe inside describe`
      - Try to keep with mixins and not with functions
  ☐ Messages
    ☐ `module::child-module` not working. Depends on fixing the context first `IF used with child + parent`
    @critical --- `above this only after initial release` --- @critical 
    
Fix/to do now:
    ✔ Assert is broken, not saying test is correct (variable value) even though it says it passed @done(19-07-19 20:17)
    ☐ Report is completely broken in js (reports true and wrong amount)
    ☐ `output/expect` is broken
    ☐ Assert `$default` is being added wrong, and only to the first element `if not first test`
  ☐ Stats
    ✔ Counter is partially broken @done(19-07-18 17:09)
    ✔ Multiple files works in css. @done(19-07-19 20:24)

  ☐ Update SASSDOC or switch to DSS
  ☐ Clean up
  ☐ Readme.md
  ☐ KnownIssues.md
